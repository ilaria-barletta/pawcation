## Features 
__Homepage__: ![Welcome page and request to log in or register](add pic)

This is the main page that the user sees before registering or logging in. 
The content is centered and the style is clean and simple. 
There is a navigation bar and a footer.
The navigation bar at this stage contains only the name of the website (it works as a link to the homepage as well if the buttons present in the page are clicked and the user wants to go back to the main screen).
The navigation bar will change and provide links to additional pages only after the user has registered or logged in to their account.
A quick but clear in the scope message to the user informs them of what pawcation is. 
The message contains a link that if clicked will show reviews left by other customers.
There are then 2 buttons that let the user register if they are new or log in if they are known users. 

__Register__: ![Registration form] (add pic)

This is the first option the user has and can click on in order to provide their details to access the service. 
When clicked the user will be taken to a form page where some details will be requested. 
In particular they will be asked to provide username and password. An email can be also provided but that's optional. 
The password needs to be selected once and then typed it again for confirmation. 

__Successfully registered__: ![message showing registration successfull, user is in the system] (add pic)
When the process is complete and the user selects register they are shown a screen where options are listed in the nav bar. 
A pop up message saying "succesfully signed in" is showed to them  

__Log in__: ![log in form] (add pic)

Alternatively the user that already has an accound can just log in into it selecting the relevant button. 
In such case they will be asked to type in their username and password and both fields are mandatory. 

__Succesfully logged in__: ![message showing registration successfull, user is in the system] (add pic)
